# Android Pose Estimation

* Prerequisites
  * Add the following paths in your CMakeLists file:  
     set(pathToProject /project path/)  
     set(pathToOpenCv /OpenCVpath/)

* How to use the app
  * Post installing the app, for the cube to be displayed, to tap on the screen multiple times. This is because, the trigger for the onPose function has been implemented via an onTouch function of the activity screen.

* Expected Output
  * Cube will be displayed sporadically with the size of the cube being distorted.
